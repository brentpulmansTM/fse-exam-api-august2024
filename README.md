# Exam

## Start your exam

- Clone this repository.
- Open the folder in PyCharm.
- If you get asked to create a virtual environment, click on OK.
- Before you start coding, open the .env file and fill in the necessary information to connect with your MySQL instance (either local or in Azure, you may choose whatever works best for you).
- Download the SQL file products_database.sql (available on Canvas) and execute it on your MySQL instance.
- Execute the command `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

## Upload exam to Canvas (when your exam is finished!)

- Create a ZIP file from the Python project and rename this ZIP file to API_class_lastName_firstName.zip, so for example API_1ITF01_Doe_John.zip
- Upload the file API_1ITF01_Doe_John.zip to Canvas (at the right question)

## IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE YOU START YOUR EXAM!

- If you can't copy sourcecode from Chrome, use Firefox or Edge instead (Proctorio sometimes blocks copy/paste in Chrome)
- You're not allowed to use any form of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to solve the exam
- All activities are monitored and recorded with Proctorio and AI cheating detection (cheating is exam fraud!)
- Do not wait until the last few minutes to create the ZIP file because there is a chance that you will
  not be able to upload your exam on time!
